This repository demonstrates using the Safe-core-sdk to authenticate via Web3Auth and create a Safe vault.

## How to use

Follow these steps to install and run the example:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start

The example serves as a playground to test the @safe-global/auth-kit package. The package is relatively imported from the root of the project:

import { SafeAuthKit, SafeAuthProviderType, SafeAuthSignInData } from '../../src/index'
